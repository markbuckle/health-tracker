## VO2 Max and All-Cause Mortality

### The power of maximal aerobic capacity

Not only has it been shown that increasing VO2 max is associated with a monotonic risk reduction in cardiovascular mortality, but increasing VO2 max is also associated with a monotonic risk reduction of all-cause mortality (ACM) at any age.

### The 2018 Mandsager Study

In 2018, Mandsager and colleagues published a retrospective study of more than 120,000 adults undergoing treadmill exercise testing, a common method for measuring VO2 max.

**Key findings:**

- Those in the top 2.3 percentile (the "elite" category) for VO2 max by age and sex had the lowest risk of both cardiorespiratory and all-cause mortality
- The lowest 25% of cardiorespiratory fitness (the "low" group) had more than a **five-fold increase** in risk of ACM
- Someone in the lowest category of fitness was five times more likely to die of any cause than someone in the elite category

### VO2 Max compared to other mortality predictors

To appreciate the astounding magnitude of this association between low VO2 max and mortality risk, we need only look at how it compares with other predictors of ACM.

**Being unfit has a much greater influence on lifespan than:**
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Coronary artery disease
- Smoking

### The Kokkinos Study findings

Kokkinos et al. found that comorbidities – including smoking, diabetes, and cancer – all increased the risk of ACM less than being at or below the 80th percentile for CRF (cardiorespiratory fitness).

**Even age was a worse predictor of ACM than VO2 max.**

Having poor cardiovascular fitness is more strongly associated with the risk of death than being old.

### Beyond cardiovascular mortality

The connection between reduced cardiovascular mortality and VO2 max may seem relatively obvious. Since cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death, you might assume this is the primary reason for the reduction in ACM. However, the influence of VO2 max on mortality risk likely goes beyond cardiovascular health.

## Zone 2 Training

### Using HRV to predict zone 2

Some practitioners use apps like Morpheus that use morning HRV to predict zone 2 for the day. Zone 2 heart rate can vary anywhere between 129 bpm – 140 bpm, usually in the 135-138 range.

## Rucking

### Getting started with rucking

- Start low and move up slow
- Hip belts allow you to put more weight on your hips than your shoulders
- Some practitioners use specific boots rather than minimalist shoes

### Monitoring considerations

- Watch for hip asymmetry
- Track heart rate recovery (how quickly heart rate comes down 1 minute after peak heart rate)

## Daily Exercise Routine

### Exercise every day, first thing in the morning

**Weekly breakdown:**
- 4 hours of zone 2 per week
- 1 higher intensity workout geared toward VO2 max
- 4 strength training sessions per week
- Other activities like rucking and recreational activities
