# General Health - Preventative Health Framework

## Core Philosophy on Lab Reference Ranges

### Understanding "normal" vs "optimal"

"We never want to confuse a laboratory's standard of what is 'normal' for what might be 'optimal', because the laboratory is simply reporting on a population distribution. And if the population's health is deteriorating over a 50 year period of time, well that isn't necessarily a reason that we should hold ourselves to the standards of unhealthy people today."

## The Most Common All-Cause Mortalities

### Leading causes of death in people over 50 who do not smoke

The following account for over 80% of deaths:

1. **Cardiovascular Disease** - 19 million deaths annually
2. **Cancer** - 12-13 million deaths annually
3. **Neurodegenerative Disease**
4. **Metabolic Disease**
5. **Accidents**

## Accidents

### Motor Vehicle Accidents

#### Statistics on automotive accidents

Unfortunately, nearly 18,000 automotive accidents occur every day in the US, on average. This frequency multiplied by the low severity still amounted to nearly 37,000 automotive fatalities in 2018.

#### Comparison to air travel

To put this into perspective: Between 2000 and 2018, there were 778 fatalities from US scheduled air travel. Over the same time span, there were 723,530 automotive fatalities—almost 1,000 times greater than the number of fatalities from scheduled air travel.

## Optimal Biomarker Ranges

### General guidelines for optimal health

These are general guidelines:

- **Fasting glucose**: <100 mg/dL
- **Hemoglobin A1c**: <5.5%
- **Fasting insulin**: <5 μIU/mL
- **Vitamin D**: 40-60 ng/mL
- **C-reactive protein**: <1.0 mg/L
- **Triglycerides**: <150 mg/dL
- **HDL cholesterol**: >40 mg/dL (men), >50 mg/dL (women)
- **LDL cholesterol**: <130 mg/dL (optimal), 130-160 mg/dL (near optimal)
- **Total cholesterol**: <200 mg/dL
- **Testosterone**: 350-1000 ng/dL (men)
- **TSH**: 0.5-2 mIU/L
- **Magnesium**: 1.7-2.2 mg/dL

### Interpreting lab results

It's important to interpret lab tests in context, focusing on trends over time, and using ranges as guides not rigid cut-offs. The optimal range for an individual depends on many factors. Discuss reference ranges with your personal physician based on your health profile and goals.

## The Most Important Biomarkers to Track

1. **ApoB** - Most important for cardiovascular risk
2. **Fasting insulin** - Critical for metabolic health
3. **VO2 max** - Strongest predictor of all-cause mortality
4. **eGFR (via Cystatin C)** - Kidney function trends
5. **Homocysteine** - Cardiovascular and cognitive health
6. **Desmosterol** - Brain cholesterol synthesis (if on statins)

## Summary: The Four Pillars of Preventative Health

### 1. Cardiovascular Disease Prevention
- Monitor and manage ApoB levels (ideally <60 mg/dL)
- Address the four causal drivers: ApoB, insulin resistance, hypertension, and smoking
- Consider advanced imaging beyond calcium scores for comprehensive risk assessment

### 2. Cancer Screening and Prevention
- Implement aggressive early screening protocols
- Stack multiple tests to increase predictive value
- Focus on modifiable factors: exercise, sleep, stress management, nutrition
- Remember: Early detection dramatically improves outcomes

### 3. Metabolic Health Optimization
- Maintain low fasting insulin (<5 μIU/mL)
- Keep HbA1c <5.5%
- Maximize VO2 max (being unfit is worse than most disease states)
- Engage in 4 hours of zone 2 training weekly plus strength training

### 4. Neurodegenerative Disease Prevention
- Monitor Desmosterol levels if on statins
- Manage homocysteine levels aggressively with B vitamins
- Support gut health with insoluble fiber
- Prioritize sleep quality

## Remember

"We never want to confuse a laboratory's standard of what is 'normal' for what might be 'optimal'."

The goal is not just to avoid disease, but to optimize healthspan and maintain function as long as possible.
