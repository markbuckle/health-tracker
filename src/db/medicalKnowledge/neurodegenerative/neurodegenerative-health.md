## Statin Use and Dementia Risk

### Cholesterol synthesis in the CNS

In the CNS (Central Nervous System), there is one cholesterol synthesis pathway, and Desmosterol is the second-to-final step in this pathway.

### Using Desmosterol as a biomarker

**Desmosterol levels** are a decent proxy for brain cholesterol synthesis.

**Lathosterol** (the equivalent to Desmosterol in the Peripheral Nervous System pathway) is a decent proxy for atherosclerosis.

### Current testing practices

This is not standard of care; however, some preventative health experts measure this for every patient. Boston Heart is one of the only blood labs that will measure it.

### Clinical decision-making threshold

Some experts recommend taking patients off statins if Desmosterol falls below 0.8 mg/dL, as the risk of dementia is high enough at that point.

### How to Improve Working Memory

#### The importance of working memory

Working memory is critical for:
- Learning and productivity
- Strategy setting
- Goal seeking
- Task switching
- Navigating new environments

#### The key role of dopamine

The biological mechanisms underlying working memory involve dopamine. Working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.

## Mental Health and Distress Tolerance

### Building distress tolerance

All of the above factors contribute to what experts consider a wider buffer zone around distress tolerance.

### Therapeutic approaches

- Therapy usually once per week, sometimes twice (DBT technique)
- Journaling
- "Writing sharpens your thinking so much"
