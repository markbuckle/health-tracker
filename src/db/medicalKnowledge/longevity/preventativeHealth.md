# Preventative Health Research - Evidence-Based Framework

## Core Philosophy on Lab Reference Ranges

### Understanding "normal" vs "optimal"

"We never want to confuse a laboratory's standard of what is 'normal' for what might be 'optimal', because the laboratory is simply reporting on a population distribution. And if the population's health is deteriorating over a 50 year period of time, well that isn't necessarily a reason that we should hold ourselves to the standards of unhealthy people today."

## The Most Common All-Cause Mortalities

### Leading causes of death in people over 50 who do not smoke

The following account for over 80% of deaths:

1. **Cardiovascular Disease** - 19 million deaths annually
2. **Cancer** - 12-13 million deaths annually
3. **Neurodegenerative Disease**
4. **Metabolic Disease**
5. **Accidents**

# Cardiovascular Disease

## Risk Assessment by Age

### How diagnostic tools change with age

The younger you are, the more your bloodwork and calcium score tells us about your risk of cardiovascular disease. Preventative health experts rely more heavily on CT angiograms for older patients.

### The limitation of calcium scores

One study found that 50% of patients had atherosclerotic events caused by a site of non-calcified lesions. This shows that low calcium scores do not necessarily mean no risk.

## ApoB (Apolipoprotein B) Levels

### The ideal ApoB threshold

"If you had an ApoB level below 30 mg/dL, it wouldn't be possible to die from atherosclerosis. However, most people cannot get down to 30 without a pharmacologic intervention such as a PCSK9 inhibitor or Bempedoic Acid (prohibitively expensive)."

### Lifetime exposure matters

"A patient with an ApoB level that never exceeded 60 is very different than a patient that showed up at 120 and we lowered them down to 60."

### What is ASCVD?

Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) is the general term for many different disorders that result from a thickening and loss of elasticity of the arterial wall. It includes stroke, heart attack, and damage to peripheral arteries.

## Lowering ApoB Through Diet

### Dietary strategies to reduce ApoB

ApoB is relatively difficult to lower, but most people can lower it via diet through the VLDL and Triglyceride pathway:

1. **Carbohydrate restriction** (refined and starchy) - Fruits and vegetables don't seem to play into elevated VLDL levels
2. **Saturated fat consumption** - Most types of saturated fat tend to directly alter cholesterol synthesis. This doesn't seem to be true for all saturated fats but we don't have great data on the subject yet. For example, C16 (from Coconut oil or Palm Oil) tends to have greater impact than C18 or C19.

## The Four Causal Drivers of Cardiovascular Atherosclerosis

The four biggest things that we know causally drive cardiovascular atherosclerosis:

1. **ApoB**
2. **Insulin Resistance**
3. **Hypertension**
4. **Smoking**

# Statins - Cholesterol Lowering Drugs

## History of Cholesterol-Lowering Drug Development

### 1960 - The Triparanol (MER/29) disaster

**Why it's important not to assume FDA approval means a drug is safe:**

Triparanol was the first LDL-lowering drug approved. It was approved because it did what the drug intended to do: lowering LDL levels. However, in the studies, the only thing being monitored was lipid panels and cholesterol levels.

This drug worked by inhibiting the Desmosterol to Cholesterol conversion, thereby significantly increasing Desmosterol levels in individuals, leading to many fatal heart attacks.

### 1980 - Bile acid sequestrants

These had tons of side effects.

### 1987 - First statin developed

The side effect profile was still significantly high until the 3rd or 4th statin was released.

## Current Statin Side Effect Profile

### Four main side effects to monitor

1. **Muscle soreness** - About 7% of users experience this. The good news is that once they are off the statins, the soreness goes away.

2. **Insulin resistance** - About 0.4% of users go on to develop type 2 diabetes as a result of the insulin resistance caused by statins.

3. **Increase in Transaminases** (liver inflammation)

4. **Impact on mitochondria** - In theory, statins should reduce mitochondrial function via the Ubiquinol/Coenzyme Q10 pathway. There is unfortunately no well-designed study to support this. However, based on zone 2 lactate testing with patients, this impact, if it exists, appears to be very small.

## Mitochondrial Function and Aging

### The hallmark of metabolic health

The healthier an individual is, the more they can rely on ATP production under increasing demand from the cell. This is one of the hallmarks of health.

### The hallmark of aging and disease

By extension, one of the hallmarks of aging/disease is the inability to maintain ATP production. As the ATP demand on the cell goes up, there is an earlier and earlier shift to glycolysis as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation.

---

# Metformin

## Metformin and Geroprotection Debate

### Metformin's impact on mitochondria

Metformin is a proven mitochondrial toxin. By impairing complex 1 of the mitochondria, we immediately see a change in lactate performance curve in an individual via a reduction in their zone 2 output.

### Observable effects in zone 2 testing

Patients on Metformin hit lactate of 2mmol/L earlier. We also see a rise in their fasting/resting lactate level.

### Why some experts don't recommend it for longevity

For this reason, some preventative health experts do not believe Metformin is a geroprotective drug like many others believe. Notably, practitioners do not see this lactate effect with statins.

---

# Exercise

## VO2 Max and All-Cause Mortality

### The power of maximal aerobic capacity

Not only has it been shown that increasing VO2 max is associated with a monotonic risk reduction in cardiovascular mortality, but increasing VO2 max is also associated with a monotonic risk reduction of all-cause mortality (ACM) at any age.

Reference: https://peterattiamd.com/all-things-vo2-max/

### The 2018 Mandsager Study

In 2018, Mandsager and colleagues published a retrospective study of more than 120,000 adults undergoing treadmill exercise testing, a common method for measuring VO2 max.

**Key findings:**

- Those in the top 2.3 percentile (the "elite" category) for VO2 max by age and sex had the lowest risk of both cardiorespiratory and all-cause mortality
- The lowest 25% of cardiorespiratory fitness (the "low" group) had more than a **five-fold increase** in risk of ACM
- Someone in the lowest category of fitness was five times more likely to die of any cause than someone in the elite category

### VO2 Max compared to other mortality predictors

To appreciate the astounding magnitude of this association between low VO2 max and mortality risk, we need only look at how it compares with other predictors of ACM.

**Being unfit has a much greater influence on lifespan than:**
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Coronary artery disease
- Smoking

### The Kokkinos Study findings

Kokkinos et al. found that comorbidities – including smoking, diabetes, and cancer – all increased the risk of ACM less than being at or below the 80th percentile for CRF (cardiorespiratory fitness).

**Even age was a worse predictor of ACM than VO2 max.**

Having poor cardiovascular fitness is more strongly associated with the risk of death than being old.

### Beyond cardiovascular mortality

The connection between reduced cardiovascular mortality and VO2 max may seem relatively obvious. Since cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death, you might assume this is the primary reason for the reduction in ACM. However, the influence of VO2 max on mortality risk likely goes beyond cardiovascular health.

## Zone 2 Training

### Using HRV to predict zone 2

Some practitioners use apps like Morpheus that use morning HRV to predict zone 2 for the day. Zone 2 heart rate can vary anywhere between 129 bpm – 140 bpm, usually in the 135-138 range.

# Homocysteine and Methylation

## The Relationship Between Homocysteine and Cardiovascular Disease

### Why homocysteine matters

We know that elevated homocysteine is associated with poor outcomes in cardiovascular disease.

### MTHFR gene considerations

If individuals are homozygous for the MTHFR gene, then the following interventions (in theory/mechanistically) should reduce homocysteine through improved clearance of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA):

- Sauna
- B-vitamins
- Methyl Folate
- Magnesium
- Cocoa flavonoids

### How ADMA and SDMA affect blood pressure

ADMA and SDMA are derivatives of L-Arginine. When ADMA (directly) and SDMA (indirectly) clearance is impaired, it inhibits Nitric Oxide synthase, which we know leads to elevated blood pressure.

### The importance of Nitric Oxide

Nitric Oxide is one of the most important molecules as it pertains to endothelial function. It's so important that it led to a Nobel Prize.

# Cancer Risk

## Understanding Cancer Risk Factors

### Fat distribution and cancer risk

Subcutaneous fat does not increase cancer risk to our knowledge. Visceral fat, on the other hand, is highly correlated with increased cancer risk.

### Best tools for reducing cancer risk

The best tools for reducing cancer risk include:
- Exercise
- Sleep
- Stress management
- Nutrition

## The Challenge of Cancer Prevention

### Cancer remains a black box

Cancer is still a bit of a black box. Almost everyone knows someone who's been afflicted with cancer who otherwise did everything right (lifestyle-wise).

### Comparison to cardiovascular disease

In cardiovascular disease, we talked about the modifiable risk factors which account for all aspects of ASCVD risk. In cancer, however, the modifiable risk factors account for **less than 50% of cancer cases**.

### Why aggressive screening is necessary

Aggressive screening has to be done because the only thing that we know is true is that if you treat cancer at an early stage, you will have a better outcome than if you treat it at a late stage.

### The cost argument

The argument that "well, screening is too expensive" may be true, but it's a lot cheaper than treating late-stage cancer with expensive drugs that do very little.

## Cancer Screening Approaches

### Understanding your personal risk

If you don't have any genetic risk factors (to your knowledge) and/or no family history of cancer, you still need to understand your risk appetite and your finances.

### Mammography recommendations

Mammography is always recommended with Ultrasound.

### Understanding test accuracy

You need to understand the risk for false positives. Preventative health experts teach patients about specificity and sensitivity. You want very high positive predictive value (PPV) and very high negative predictive value (NPV).

**Both PPV and NPV are a function of 3 things:**

1. **Specificity** – the ability of a test to detect a condition being present if it is indeed present
2. **Sensitivity** – the ability of a test to conclude that something is absent if it is indeed absent
3. **Prevalence** – how likely is it that you have this condition before testing? (Pre-test probability)

### The importance of stacking tests

There is no perfect test for cancer screening. You must stack tests on top of each other in order to increase PPV and NPV. If you rely on any one test by itself, you're always going to have a blindspot.

## Specific Cancer Screening Guidelines

### Colonoscopy

**Test characteristics:**
- 100% specificity
- About 85% sensitivity
- Great for PPV, not bad for NPV
- Additional risks come with colonoscopies

**Current guidelines:**
- Used to be every 10 years starting at 50
- Now starting at 45
- Debate about whether it should be every 5 or 10 years

**Expert recommendations** (for those without family history or other risk factors like IBD, Crohn's, etc.):
- Get it done at 40
- Re-test every 3 years depending on findings
- Sometimes findings will require more frequent testing (e.g., Sessile/Flat Polyp)
- Re-test in a year if patient has incomplete bowel prep

### Mammogram and Ultrasound

For those with previous family history or other risk:
- Start mammogram and ultrasound at 40
- Stagger them every 6 months (each test once per year)

### CT Scans and radiation considerations

CT Scans give off a lot of radiation. The only way to justify the use of a CT scan is:
- In a current or former smoker
- Low-dose CT scan for lung cancer

**Why lung cancer screening matters:**
- Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally and in the US for both men and women
- 85% of lung cancers occur in former smokers or current smokers

### Understanding radiation exposure

**Radiation units:**
Radiation is measured in units called millisieverts (mSv).

**Safe exposure levels:**
It's generally established that exposure to more than 50 mSv per year will increase your risk of neogenesis (cancer).

**Context for environmental exposure:**
- Living at sea level in San Diego: 1-2 mSv per year (2-4% of annual allotment)
- Living in Denver: Double that (4-8% of annual allotment)
- Being one mile in the sky doubles your radiation exposure

**Medical imaging radiation:**
- CT Angiogram 20 years ago: 20 mSv (40% of annual allotment)
- CT Angiogram today: Less than 1 mSv
- Mammogram/Ultrasound and DEXA: Even less radiation

### Grail test

The Grail test is different from mammograms, ultrasound, or any other type of test. It's a liquid biopsy approach for early cancer detection.

### Liquid biopsies

As of May 2020, there are a few companies in phase 2/3 trials using liquid biopsies to screen early for cancer detection.

Reference: Episode #290 - Liquid biopsies for early cancer detection

## Cancer Statistics and Age Distribution

### US cancer diagnosis and mortality rates

**Men:**
- Cancer diagnosis rate: Just under 41%
- Cancer mortality risk: 20.2%

**Women:**
- Cancer diagnosis rate: 39.1%
- Cancer mortality risk: 17.7%

### Age-based mortality causes

According to CDC report on causes of death in 2021 (omitting COVID-19 deaths):

- Accidents in younger age groups are primarily due to overdose
- ASCVD and cancer keep switching back and forth in the 45-54 age group
- There is not an age group in life where cancer is not a top 3 killer

### The lower the tumor burden, the better the outcome

The lower the burden of tumor, the greater the effectiveness of cancer treatments.

## Genetic Factors in Cancer

### Most cancers lack deterministic genes

For cancer, there doesn't appear to be a single deterministic gene (aka fully penetrant), even though some can certainly contribute to dysregulated cell growth.

**Example:** BRCA-1 has 60-80% penetrance

### Lynch syndrome

APC in Lynch syndrome is almost deterministic. In other words, if you live long enough and you have Lynch syndrome, you're almost certainly going to get colon cancer.

## Comparing Cancer and Heart Disease

### What we know about ASCVD

Fortunately, we do understand the big four drivers of ASCVD:
1. Lipoproteins
2. Hypertension
3. Smoking
4. Metabolic health

There are certainly genetic factors to pay attention to, such as Lp(a) and familial hypercholesterolemia. But these tend to be issues that can be managed pharmacologically.

**Key advantages in ASCVD:**
- Clear understanding of disease progression
- Biomarkers that predict risk
- Tools like CT angiograms to assess anatomy and disease advancement

### What we don't know about cancer

Unfortunately, when it comes to cancer, none of the above factors are really true.

Outside of smoking, certain genetic conditions, and poor metabolic health, it's still a bit of a black box as to why people get cancer, and more importantly, what one can do to reduce risk.

### Two things working AGAINST us in cancer

What we have to acknowledge is that we have two things working AGAINST us in the cancer equation that we have working FOR us in the heart disease equation:

1. We have far less command over the biology of the disease
2. We have far fewer effective treatments for the disease once it is advanced

# Neurodegenerative Disease

## Statin Use and Dementia Risk

### Cholesterol synthesis in the CNS

In the CNS (Central Nervous System), there is one cholesterol synthesis pathway, and Desmosterol is the second-to-final step in this pathway.

### Using Desmosterol as a biomarker

**Desmosterol levels** are a decent proxy for brain cholesterol synthesis.

**Lathosterol** (the equivalent to Desmosterol in the Peripheral Nervous System pathway) is a decent proxy for atherosclerosis.

### Current testing practices

This is not standard of care; however, some preventative health experts measure this for every patient. Boston Heart is one of the only blood labs that will measure it.

### Clinical decision-making threshold

Some experts recommend taking patients off statins if Desmosterol falls below 0.8 mg/dL, as the risk of dementia is high enough at that point.

---

# Personal Health Regimen Examples

## Sleep

### Sleep optimization tools

- **8sleep mattress** - Considered far better than anything else on the market
- **Supplements**: Glycine, Magnesium L-Threonate and Magnesium Oxide, and Ashwagandha
- Avoid anything that will activate the mind (email, phone, etc.)
- Sauna/shower immediately before bed

## Nutrition

### Omnivore approach focused on real foods

Practitioners who have tried every type of diet often settle on an omnivore diet focused on real foods (non-processed).

**Main nutritional goals:**
- Maintain energy balance
- Consume enough protein: 40-50 grams at least 4 times per day
- Avoid eating 4 hours before bed

## Alcohol

### Moderate approach

0-7 drinks per week, no more than 2 drinks per night. Only consume if it's well worth it.

## Exercise

### Daily exercise routine

Exercise every day, first thing in the morning.

**Weekly breakdown:**
- 4 hours of zone 2 per week
- 1 higher intensity workout geared toward VO2 max
- 4 strength training sessions per week
- Other activities like rucking and recreational activities

## Mental Health

### Building distress tolerance

All of the above factors contribute to what experts consider a wider buffer zone around distress tolerance.

### Therapeutic approaches

- Therapy usually once per week, sometimes twice (DBT technique)
- Journaling
- "Writing sharpens your thinking so much"

---

# Accidents

## Motor Vehicle Accidents

### Statistics on automotive accidents

Unfortunately, nearly 18,000 automotive accidents occur every day in the US, on average. This frequency multiplied by the low severity still amounted to nearly 37,000 automotive fatalities in 2018.

### Comparison to air travel

To put this into perspective: Between 2000 and 2018, there were 778 fatalities from US scheduled air travel. Over the same time span, there were 723,530 automotive fatalities—almost 1,000 times greater than the number of fatalities from scheduled air travel.

# Neuroscience and Mental Health

## How to Improve Working Memory

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQlTmOFM4Qs

### The importance of working memory

Working memory is critical for:
- Learning and productivity
- Strategy setting
- Goal seeking
- Task switching
- Navigating new environments

### The key role of dopamine

The biological mechanisms underlying working memory involve dopamine. Working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.

## Supplements and Drugs for Working Memory

**Note:** These are for people with low baseline working memory/dopamine levels

### L-Tyrosine

- **Starting dose**: 500mg is usually a good starting point
- Establish the minimal effective dose
- Some people experience a crash 3-4 hours after taking it

### Mucuna Pruriens

- Biosimilar to L-Dopa
- Very potent with significant impacts on dopamine levels
- **Starting dose**: Start very low (250-500mg) to establish minimal effective dose
- Considered a bridge between dopamine supplements and prescription medications

### Bromocriptine

- Prescription required
- Peak dopamine in 90 minutes

# Actions and Tools

## Rucking

### Getting started with rucking

- Start low and move up slow
- Hip belts allow you to put more weight on your hips than your shoulders
- Some practitioners use specific boots rather than minimalist shoes

### Monitoring considerations

- Watch for hip asymmetry
- Track heart rate recovery (how quickly heart rate comes down 1 minute after peak heart rate)

## Kidney Health

### Better biomarkers for kidney function

**Cystatin C** is a better indicator of kidney health than Creatinine Kinase.

**eGFR** (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) should be measured using the Cystatin C estimate rather than the CK estimate.

### Understanding kidney function decline

"We need to think about the kidneys in a much longer time frame and think about how healthy your kidneys are going to be for a given age, given that we know your kidney function is going to decline with age."

### The ApoB analogy for kidneys

Similar to ApoB: If a person has very high ApoB in early life, it's not going to be as big of a deal as if they have it at mid-life, where they've had more of a chance to accumulate damage. There's an inevitability of decline.

### Normal eGFR ranges

A young healthy adult (<50 years old) should have an eGFR of at least **90 ml/min/1.73m²** (normalized to body surface area).

**Expected decline:**
Statistically speaking, eGFR will decrease somewhere between 6-10 units per decade starting in your 5th decade.

**Chronic Kidney Disease diagnosis:**
People do not diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD) until eGFR falls below 60.

### Primary causes of CKD

70% of CKD cases in the US are caused by:
- Metabolic dysfunction (primarily Type 2 Diabetes)
- Hypertension

## Homocysteine Management

### Aggressive approach to healthy homocysteine levels

Some preventative health practices aggressively target healthy homocysteine levels with all patients by using B vitamins:

- **Folic acid**: 800 mcg/day
- **B12**: 500 mcg/day
- **B6**: 20-50 mg/day

**Supplement recommendation:** Gero-combine is a good supplement option.

### Target homocysteine levels

For 70-year-olds, homocysteine should be below 9.

### Relationship between kidney function and homocysteine

Lower GFR leads to higher homocysteine, ADMA, and SDMA.

---

# Gut Health

## Choosing Quality Probiotics

### The challenge of probiotic manufacturing

First, probiotics have to be alive, which turns out to be much harder than most companies appreciate.

### Why anaerobes are important

Most of the probiotics need to be anaerobes since those are the bacteria that you're trying to replenish in the colon.

### Manufacturing challenges

An anaerobe has to be manufactured in a completely oxygen-free environment, which is really hard to do. From a manufacturing process, it's very difficult.

### The CFU problem

Most probiotic companies, when they make their probiotic with the best of intentions, think they're making the correct product. But when they count the units and tell you "we have this many CFUs" (colony-forming units), they're not actually checking if they're alive or not.

**By the time these products get to you, they're completely dead.**

### What "alive" means for probiotics

When we say "alive," we mean freeze-dried and will come back to life when you ingest it.

### Rule number one

You have to actually buy from somebody who knows what they're making and is able to verify with more sophisticated tools that you're actually getting alive bacteria.

## Akkermansia and Butyrate Production

### The role of Akkermansia

Some probiotics are rich in a bacteria called Akkermansia, which plays a very important role in butyrate production.

### Why butyrate matters

Butyrate is very important in:
- Metabolism
- Short-chain fatty acid metabolism
- Glucose metabolism

### Clinical evidence

This type of probiotic has been demonstrated in a small but rigorous and blinded study to lower glucose levels. Hence products like "Glucose Control."

## The Importance of Insoluble Fiber

### The most important thing you feed your gut

Lots of insoluble fiber. This is the most important thing you feed your gut.

### Why vegetables matter for gut health

For all the arguments about why vegetables matter, this might be the most important reason. And it's the one that you can't get around.

### You can't shortcut fiber intake

You can drink a green drink (like AG) and get a lot of the vitamins that come in vegetables and even get the phytochemicals, but the fiber—you can't get in volume in that format. You're not getting enough fiber.

### You must consume insoluble fiber

You have to be able to consume insoluble fiber to actually feed your gut. Most people are deficient in this.

## Best Sources of Insoluble Fiber

### Salad ingredients

Favorite sources of insoluble fiber include salad ingredients:
- Lettuce
- Cucumbers
- Carrots
- Celery
- All salad vegetables

These provide the lion's share of insoluble fiber for many people.

# Summary: Key Takeaways for Longevity

## The Four Pillars of Preventative Health

### 1. Cardiovascular Disease Prevention
- Monitor and manage ApoB levels (ideally <60 mg/dL)
- Address the four causal drivers: ApoB, insulin resistance, hypertension, and smoking
- Consider advanced imaging beyond calcium scores for comprehensive risk assessment

### 2. Cancer Screening and Prevention
- Implement aggressive early screening protocols
- Stack multiple tests to increase predictive value
- Focus on modifiable factors: exercise, sleep, stress management, nutrition
- Remember: Early detection dramatically improves outcomes

### 3. Metabolic Health Optimization
- Maintain low fasting insulin (<5 μIU/mL)
- Keep HbA1c <5.5%
- Maximize VO2 max (being unfit is worse than most disease states)
- Engage in 4 hours of zone 2 training weekly plus strength training

### 4. Neurodegenerative Disease Prevention
- Monitor Desmosterol levels if on statins
- Manage homocysteine levels aggressively with B vitamins
- Support gut health with insoluble fiber
- Prioritize sleep quality

## The Most Important Biomarkers to Track

1. **ApoB** - Most important for cardiovascular risk
2. **Fasting insulin** - Critical for metabolic health
3. **VO2 max** - Strongest predictor of all-cause mortality
4. **eGFR (via Cystatin C)** - Kidney function trends
5. **Homocysteine** - Cardiovascular and cognitive health
6. **Desmosterol** - Brain cholesterol synthesis (if on statins)

## Remember

"We never want to confuse a laboratory's standard of what is 'normal' for what might be 'optimal'."

The goal is not just to avoid disease, but to optimize healthspan and maintain function as long as possible.
