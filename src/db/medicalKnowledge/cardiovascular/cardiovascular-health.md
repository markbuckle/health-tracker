## Risk Assessment by Age

### How diagnostic tools change with age

The younger you are, the more your bloodwork and calcium score tells us about your risk of cardiovascular disease. Preventative health experts rely more heavily on CT angiograms for older patients.

### The limitation of calcium scores

One study found that 50% of patients had atherosclerotic events caused by a site of non-calcified lesions. This shows that low calcium scores do not necessarily mean no risk.

## ApoB (Apolipoprotein B) Levels

### The ideal ApoB threshold

"If you had an ApoB level below 30 mg/dL, it wouldn't be possible to die from atherosclerosis. However, most people cannot get down to 30 without a pharmacologic intervention such as a PCSK9 inhibitor or Bempedoic Acid (prohibitively expensive)."

### Lifetime exposure matters

"A patient with an ApoB level that never exceeded 60 is very different than a patient that showed up at 120 and we lowered them down to 60."

### What is ASCVD?

Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) is the general term for many different disorders that result from a thickening and loss of elasticity of the arterial wall. It includes stroke, heart attack, and damage to peripheral arteries.

## Lowering ApoB Through Diet

### Dietary strategies to reduce ApoB

ApoB is relatively difficult to lower, but most people can lower it via diet through the VLDL and Triglyceride pathway:

1. **Carbohydrate restriction** (refined and starchy) - Fruits and vegetables don't seem to play into elevated VLDL levels
2. **Saturated fat consumption** - Most types of saturated fat tend to directly alter cholesterol synthesis. This doesn't seem to be true for all saturated fats but we don't have great data on the subject yet. For example, C16 (from Coconut oil or Palm Oil) tends to have greater impact than C18 or C19.

## The Four Causal Drivers of Cardiovascular Atherosclerosis

The four biggest things that we know causally drive cardiovascular atherosclerosis:

1. **ApoB**
2. **Insulin Resistance**
3. **Hypertension**
4. **Smoking**

## Homocysteine and Cardiovascular Disease

### Why homocysteine matters

We know that elevated homocysteine is associated with poor outcomes in cardiovascular disease.

### MTHFR gene considerations

If individuals are homozygous for the MTHFR gene, then the following interventions (in theory/mechanistically) should reduce homocysteine through improved clearance of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA):

- Sauna
- B-vitamins
- Methyl Folate
- Magnesium
- Cocoa flavonoids

### How ADMA and SDMA affect blood pressure

ADMA and SDMA are derivatives of L-Arginine. When ADMA (directly) and SDMA (indirectly) clearance is impaired, it inhibits Nitric Oxide synthase, which we know leads to elevated blood pressure.

### The importance of Nitric Oxide

Nitric Oxide is one of the most important molecules as it pertains to endothelial function. It's so important that it led to a Nobel Prize.

## Homocysteine Management

### Aggressive approach to healthy homocysteine levels

Some preventative health practices aggressively target healthy homocysteine levels with all patients by using B vitamins:

- **Folic acid**: 800 mcg/day
- **B12**: 500 mcg/day
- **B6**: 20-50 mg/day

**Supplement recommendation:** Gero-combine is a good supplement option.

### Target homocysteine levels

For 70-year-olds, homocysteine should be below 9.

### Relationship between kidney function and homocysteine

Lower GFR leads to higher homocysteine, ADMA, and SDMA.
