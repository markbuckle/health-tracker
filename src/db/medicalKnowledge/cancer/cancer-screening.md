# Cancer Screening and Prevention

## Understanding Cancer Risk Factors

### Fat distribution and cancer risk

Subcutaneous fat does not increase cancer risk to our knowledge. Visceral fat, on the other hand, is highly correlated with increased cancer risk.

### Best tools for reducing cancer risk

The best tools for reducing cancer risk include:
- Exercise
- Sleep
- Stress management
- Nutrition

## The Challenge of Cancer Prevention

### Cancer remains a black box

Cancer is still a bit of a black box. Almost everyone knows someone who's been afflicted with cancer who otherwise did everything right (lifestyle-wise).

### Comparison to cardiovascular disease

In cardiovascular disease, we talked about the modifiable risk factors which account for all aspects of ASCVD risk. In cancer, however, the modifiable risk factors account for **less than 50% of cancer cases**.

### Why aggressive screening is necessary

Aggressive screening has to be done because the only thing that we know is true is that if you treat cancer at an early stage, you will have a better outcome than if you treat it at a late stage.

### The cost argument

The argument that "well, screening is too expensive" may be true, but it's a lot cheaper than treating late-stage cancer with expensive drugs that do very little.

## Cancer Screening Approaches

### Understanding your personal risk

If you don't have any genetic risk factors (to your knowledge) and/or no family history of cancer, you still need to understand your risk appetite and your finances.

### Mammography recommendations

Mammography is always recommended with Ultrasound.

### Understanding test accuracy

You need to understand the risk for false positives. Preventative health experts teach patients about specificity and sensitivity. You want very high positive predictive value (PPV) and very high negative predictive value (NPV).

**Both PPV and NPV are a function of 3 things:**

1. **Specificity** – the ability of a test to detect a condition being present if it is indeed present
2. **Sensitivity** – the ability of a test to conclude that something is absent if it is indeed absent
3. **Prevalence** – how likely is it that you have this condition before testing? (Pre-test probability)

### The importance of stacking tests

There is no perfect test for cancer screening. You must stack tests on top of each other in order to increase PPV and NPV. If you rely on any one test by itself, you're always going to have a blindspot.

## Specific Cancer Screening Guidelines

### Colonoscopy

**Test characteristics:**
- 100% specificity
- About 85% sensitivity
- Great for PPV, not bad for NPV
- Additional risks come with colonoscopies

**Current guidelines:**
- Used to be every 10 years starting at 50
- Now starting at 45
- Debate about whether it should be every 5 or 10 years

**Expert recommendations** (for those without family history or other risk factors like IBD, Crohn's, etc.):
- Get it done at 40
- Re-test every 3 years depending on findings
- Sometimes findings will require more frequent testing (e.g., Sessile/Flat Polyp)
- Re-test in a year if patient has incomplete bowel prep

### Mammogram and Ultrasound

For those with previous family history or other risk:
- Start mammogram and ultrasound at 40
- Stagger them every 6 months (each test once per year)

### CT Scans and radiation considerations

CT Scans give off a lot of radiation. The only way to justify the use of a CT scan is:
- In a current or former smoker
- Low-dose CT scan for lung cancer

**Why lung cancer screening matters:**
- Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally and in the US for both men and women
- 85% of lung cancers occur in former smokers or current smokers

### Understanding radiation exposure

**Radiation units:**
Radiation is measured in units called millisieverts (mSv).

**Safe exposure levels:**
It's generally established that exposure to more than 50 mSv per year will increase your risk of neogenesis (cancer).

**Context for environmental exposure:**
- Living at sea level in San Diego: 1-2 mSv per year (2-4% of annual allotment)
- Living in Denver: Double that (4-8% of annual allotment)
- Being one mile in the sky doubles your radiation exposure

**Medical imaging radiation:**
- CT Angiogram 20 years ago: 20 mSv (40% of annual allotment)
- CT Angiogram today: Less than 1 mSv
- Mammogram/Ultrasound and DEXA: Even less radiation

### Grail test

The Grail test is different from mammograms, ultrasound, or any other type of test. It's a liquid biopsy approach for early cancer detection.

### Liquid biopsies

As of May 2020, there are a few companies in phase 2/3 trials using liquid biopsies to screen early for cancer detection.

Reference: Episode #290 - Liquid biopsies for early cancer detection

## Cancer Statistics and Age Distribution

### US cancer diagnosis and mortality rates

**Men:**
- Cancer diagnosis rate: Just under 41%
- Cancer mortality risk: 20.2%

**Women:**
- Cancer diagnosis rate: 39.1%
- Cancer mortality risk: 17.7%

### Age-based mortality causes

According to CDC report on causes of death in 2021 (omitting COVID-19 deaths):

- Accidents in younger age groups are primarily due to overdose
- ASCVD and cancer keep switching back and forth in the 45-54 age group
- There is not an age group in life where cancer is not a top 3 killer

### The lower the tumor burden, the better the outcome

The lower the burden of tumor, the greater the effectiveness of cancer treatments.

## Genetic Factors in Cancer

### Most cancers lack deterministic genes

For cancer, there doesn't appear to be a single deterministic gene (aka fully penetrant), even though some can certainly contribute to dysregulated cell growth.

**Example:** BRCA-1 has 60-80% penetrance

### Lynch syndrome

APC in Lynch syndrome is almost deterministic. In other words, if you live long enough and you have Lynch syndrome, you're almost certainly going to get colon cancer.

## Comparing Cancer and Heart Disease

### What we know about ASCVD

Fortunately, we do understand the big four drivers of ASCVD:
1. Lipoproteins
2. Hypertension
3. Smoking
4. Metabolic health

There are certainly genetic factors to pay attention to, such as Lp(a) and familial hypercholesterolemia. But these tend to be issues that can be managed pharmacologically.

**Key advantages in ASCVD:**
- Clear understanding of disease progression
- Biomarkers that predict risk
- Tools like CT angiograms to assess anatomy and disease advancement

### What we don't know about cancer

Unfortunately, when it comes to cancer, none of the above factors are really true.

Outside of smoking, certain genetic conditions, and poor metabolic health, it's still a bit of a black box as to why people get cancer, and more importantly, what one can do to reduce risk.

### Two things working AGAINST us in cancer

What we have to acknowledge is that we have two things working AGAINST us in the cancer equation that we have working FOR us in the heart disease equation:

1. We have far less command over the biology of the disease
2. We have far fewer effective treatments for the disease once it is advanced
