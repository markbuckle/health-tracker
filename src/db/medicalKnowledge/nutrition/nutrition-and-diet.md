## Sleep Optimization

### Sleep optimization tools

- **8sleep mattress** - Considered far better than anything else on the market
- **Supplements**: Glycine, Magnesium L-Threonate and Magnesium Oxide, and Ashwagandha
- Avoid anything that will activate the mind (email, phone, etc.)
- Sauna/shower immediately before bed

## Nutritional Approach

### Omnivore approach focused on real foods

Practitioners who have tried every type of diet often settle on an omnivore diet focused on real foods (non-processed).

**Main nutritional goals:**
- Maintain energy balance
- Consume enough protein: 40-50 grams at least 4 times per day
- Avoid eating 4 hours before bed

## Alcohol Guidelines

### Moderate approach

0-7 drinks per week, no more than 2 drinks per night. Only consume if it's well worth it.
