## Choosing Quality Probiotics

### The challenge of probiotic manufacturing

First, probiotics have to be alive, which turns out to be much harder than most companies appreciate.

### Why anaerobes are important

Most of the probiotics need to be anaerobes since those are the bacteria that you're trying to replenish in the colon.

### Manufacturing challenges

An anaerobe has to be manufactured in a completely oxygen-free environment, which is really hard to do. From a manufacturing process, it's very difficult.

### The CFU problem

Most probiotic companies, when they make their probiotic with the best of intentions, think they're making the correct product. But when they count the units and tell you "we have this many CFUs" (colony-forming units), they're not actually checking if they're alive or not.

**By the time these products get to you, they're completely dead.**

### What "alive" means for probiotics

When we say "alive," we mean freeze-dried and will come back to life when you ingest it.

### Rule number one

You have to actually buy from somebody who knows what they're making and is able to verify with more sophisticated tools that you're actually getting alive bacteria.

## Akkermansia and Butyrate Production

### The role of Akkermansia

Some probiotics are rich in a bacteria called Akkermansia, which plays a very important role in butyrate production.

### Why butyrate matters

Butyrate is very important in:
- Metabolism
- Short-chain fatty acid metabolism
- Glucose metabolism

### Clinical evidence

This type of probiotic has been demonstrated in a small but rigorous and blinded study to lower glucose levels. Hence products like "Glucose Control."

## The Importance of Insoluble Fiber

### The most important thing you feed your gut

Lots of insoluble fiber. This is the most important thing you feed your gut.

### Why vegetables matter for gut health

For all the arguments about why vegetables matter, this might be the most important reason. And it's the one that you can't get around.

### You can't shortcut fiber intake

You can drink a green drink (like AG) and get a lot of the vitamins that come in vegetables and even get the phytochemicals, but the fiber—you can't get in volume in that format. You're not getting enough fiber.

### You must consume insoluble fiber

You have to be able to consume insoluble fiber to actually feed your gut. Most people are deficient in this.

## Best Sources of Insoluble Fiber

### Salad ingredients

Favorite sources of insoluble fiber include salad ingredients:
- Lettuce
- Cucumbers
- Carrots
- Celery
- All salad vegetables

These provide the lion's share of insoluble fiber for many people.
