# Metabolic Health

## Metformin and Geroprotection Debate

### Metformin's impact on mitochondria

Metformin is a proven mitochondrial toxin. By impairing complex 1 of the mitochondria, we immediately see a change in lactate performance curve in an individual via a reduction in their zone 2 output.

### Observable effects in zone 2 testing

Patients on Metformin hit lactate of 2mmol/L earlier. We also see a rise in their fasting/resting lactate level.

### Why some experts don't recommend it for longevity

For this reason, some preventative health experts do not believe Metformin is a geroprotective drug like many others believe. Notably, practitioners do not see this lactate effect with statins.

### How lactate metabolism changes

As the ATP demand on the cell goes up, there is an earlier and earlier shift to glycolysis as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation.

## Kidney Health and Metabolic Dysfunction

### Better biomarkers for kidney function

**Cystatin C** is a better indicator of kidney health than Creatinine Kinase.

**eGFR** (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) should be measured using the Cystatin C estimate rather than the CK estimate.

### Understanding kidney function decline

"We need to think about the kidneys in a much longer time frame and think about how healthy your kidneys are going to be for a given age, given that we know your kidney function is going to decline with age."

### The ApoB analogy for kidneys

Similar to ApoB: If a person has very high ApoB in early life, it's not going to be as big of a deal as if they have it at mid-life, where they've had more of a chance to accumulate damage. There's an inevitability of decline.

### Normal eGFR ranges

A young healthy adult (<50 years old) should have an eGFR of at least **90 ml/min/1.73m²** (normalized to body surface area).

**Expected decline:**
Statistically speaking, eGFR will decrease somewhere between 6-10 units per decade starting in your 5th decade.

**Chronic Kidney Disease diagnosis:**
People do not diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD) until eGFR falls below 60.

### Primary causes of CKD

70% of CKD cases in the US are caused by:
- Metabolic dysfunction (primarily Type 2 Diabetes)
- Hypertension
